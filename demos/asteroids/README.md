# Tutorial for building and running Asteroids WASM demo with Webinizer

## How to build Asteroids with Webinizer

1.  **`Main page`** - Click `Get Started` in Webinizer main page to enter the project list page.

2.  **`Get started page`** - Click the `SELECT` button of the Asteroids project.

3.  **`Editor page`** - Click the `Edit` in the top navigation panel to enter the `Project edit`
    page.

    - Click `File` -> `New File` to create empty editor panel.
    - Input following content and save as `./CMakeLists.txt` target.

      ```cmake
      cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
      project(Asteroids VERSION 1.0)
      set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)
      add_compile_options(-Wall)
      find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED)
      include_directories(${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
      set(SOURCES
          asteroids/main.c
          asteroids/vector.c
          asteroids/player.c
          asteroids/asteroids.c
          asteroids/renderer.c)
      add_executable(Asteroid ${SOURCES})
      target_link_libraries(Asteroid m ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})
      ```

4.  **`Basic config page`** - Click `BUILD STEPS ->` in the lower right corner or `Steps` in the top
    navigation panel to enter the `Build steps` page.

5.  **`Build steps page`**

    - Select the `static` build target and Webinizer will prompt you with the recommended build
      steps for the project.

    - Click `YES` to accept the recommendation.

    - Click `BUILD ->` in the lower right corner or `Build` in the top navigation panel to enter the
      `Build` page.

6.  **`Build page`**

    - Click the `BUILD` button to trigger the build and some recipes will show in several rounds of
      build.

    - `Recipe for checking project dependent packages`- Click the `APPLY RECIPE` button to accept
      the recipe.

      > Note. _We detected dependent packages required for the project and would like to use
      > Emscripten specific build options for them to use the ported Wasm versions. We may modify
      > the CMakeLists.txt file to remove unnecessary dependent packages statements._

    - `Recipe for main loop issue` - Click `Edit` in the top navigation panel and weâ€™ll be directed
      to the `Editor` page.

      > Note. _We are building an application that is running on the main thread, which is using an
      > infinite loop to render animations and thread-blocking. As the recipe suggested, we should
      > modify our source code with specific API provided by Emscripten._

7.  **`Editor page`**

    - Select the file `asteroids -> main.c` from the `Project Explorer` sidebar and modify the code
      as below. Then click the `SAVE` button to save the changes.

      ```diff
        // src/main.c
        #include <SDL.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>

      -    struct vector2d top_left = {20 + offset, 20};
      -    add_vector(&top_left, &translation);
      -    lives[i].location = top_left;
      -    update_player(&lives[i]);
      -    offset += 20;
      -  }
      -

      + int main (int argc, char* args[]) {

      +   for (j = 0; j < P_VERTS; j++) {
      +

      +   }
      +
      +   //convert screen space vector into world space

      ```

    - Select the file `CMakeLists.txt` from the `Project Explorer` sidebar and modify the code as
      below. Then click the `SAVE` button to save the changes.

      ```diff
        // CMakeLists.txt
        project(Asteroids VERSION 1.0)
      + # to generate html target
      + set(CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX ".html")
      ```

      > NOTE. _The demo is using the `html` generated by Emscripten, generally `html` target could
      > be generated with `emcc/em++ -o output.html`, which is not a suitable approach when
      > integrating with `emcmake` and `emmake`. The above suggestion is one approach to build
      > `html` target, you could also find other ways that work._

    - Click `Build` in the top navigation panel to route us back to the `Build` page.

8.  `Recipe for modularize JS output option` - Click the `APPLY RECIPE` button to accept the recipe
    as well.

    > `The html target file is not compatible with build options "-sMODULARIZE -sEXPORT_NAME=Module_"`

9.  **`Build page`** - Click the `BUILD` button to trigger the build again.

After a while, it will show `Build successfully!` on the page.
